# PaperBase

**PaperBase** is a lightweight, file-based, plug-and-play database engine designed for quick data storage using native Python and optional C++ authentication handling.

It is perfect for small projects, prototyping, or when you need a no-server, local-first database structure.

- File-system-based hierarchical database
- Insert, retrieve, edit, and delete key-value data
- User authentication using hashed passwords (with C++ auth handler)
- Easy project switching with `connect()`
- Modular access via `auth`, `config`, and `pdb`
